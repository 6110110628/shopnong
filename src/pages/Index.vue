      <h1>Wellcome to Shopnong Online</h1>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller 
        over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of 
        the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays 
        the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of 
        different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.<br><br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services 
        at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping.
         When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) 
         online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, 
         view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices.<br><br></p>
